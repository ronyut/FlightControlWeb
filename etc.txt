Our unit tests check the three conrollers (servers, flights and flightPlans) in the server.
First, we inject a mock DB in the controller constructor,
And then call a functions in the controller,
Checking that the answer we get is the same as it is in the mockDB.

operations that were tested:
posting a new server
get external servers
delete a server
get flightplan by id
post a flightplan
delete a flight
